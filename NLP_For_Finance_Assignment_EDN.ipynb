Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Matthew Roskot. Please go ahead, sir.     Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power  Light Company. Jim will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to John for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.     Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As John will describe in more detail later in the call, 2017 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. Moreover, 2017 was a year in which we successfully positioned both businesses for strong growth well into the next decade. For NextEra Energy Partners, we started 2017 by structurally modifying the IDR fee, which allowed NEP to extend its distribution growth expectations through at least 2022, avoid the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest other than modest sales under the ATM program and increase levered returns for unitholders to the low double digits on future acquisitions. This change, combined with other steps we took to improve NEP's investor value proposition over the past year, including governance enhancements, stand alone credit ratings in the mid  to high BB category and NEP's utilization of additional sources of low cost financing, helped separate NEP from its peers. We were able to grow the NEP LP distribution by 15% year over year and deliver a total unitholder return of over 75%. NEP outperformed other yieldcos by more than 55% on average, and its total shareholder return was almost 90% higher than the Alerian MLP Index. With the flexibility to grow in 3 ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties, NEP has clear visibility to support its growth going forward. As we said before, Energy Resources' portfolio as of the end of 2016 provides one potential path to support NEP's 12% to 15% growth per year through 2022. And with one of the lowest costs of capital among all yieldcos and MLPs, NEP has the currency to be competitive in acquiring long term contracted assets from other third parties going forward. With tax reform and a record renewable origination year by Energy Resources in what promises to be one of the best renewables development environments in our history over the next several years, we look forward to further improving NEP's already best in class distribution growth visibility. I continue to believe that when NEP's growth potential is combined with its substantial financing flexibility and the strength of its underlying portfolio, with an 18 year average contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, NEP offers unitholders an investor value proposition that is second to none. For these reasons, NEP is as well positioned as it's ever been, and I look forward to strong performance in 2018 and beyond. Turning now to NextEra Energy. 2017 was an outstanding year of execution across the board. Financially, we were able to grow 2017 adjusted EPS by 8.2% and extend our long term track record of delivering results for shareholders. Dating back to 2005, we've delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of over 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies who've achieved on the average compound annual growth of 2.9% over the same period. In 2017, we delivered a total shareholder return of over 34%, outperforming the SP 500 by roughly 15% and the SP Utilities Index by more than 25%. Over the last 10 years, we've outperformed 79% of the SP 500 Utilities Index and 63% of the SP 500. We were once again honored to be named, for the 11th time in 12 years, #1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune's 2018 list of World's Most Admired Companies. The strength of our 2017 execution has set the foundation for several announcements that I'm going to make on this morning's call. First, as we announced last week, tax reform provides an unprecedented opportunity to benefit FPL customers. Rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, FPL plans to recover these costs through federal tax savings, generated during its current settlement agreement. During the fourth quarter, FPL expensed the approximately $1.3 billion that was recorded as a regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery and utilized the available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of this expense, ending the year with a 0 reserve amortization balance. FPL expects to partially restore the reserve amortization utilized in the fourth quarter through tax savings and to end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to potentially avoid a base rate increase for up to 2 additional years in 2021 and 2022. As a reminder, FPL is currently allowed to earn within a permitted ROE band of 9.6% to 11.6%. The settlement agreement also allows FPL to access and utilize the accumulated reserve amortization available at the end of 2020 by deferring the initiation of a new base rate case. Based on what we see at this time and assuming normal weather and operating conditions, our goal is for FPL to continue operating under its current base rate settlement agreement for up to 2 additional years. The flexibility afforded under the settlement agreement provides FPL with the ability to return tax savings to customers in the fastest way possible. By foregoing the surcharge, FPL customers are expected to save approximately $250 on average through 2020, with a typical residential bill nearly 30% below the national average, following a $3.35 per month decrease that will take effect March 1 with the completion of cost recovery for Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, by potentially operating under the settlement agreement for up to 2 additional years, customers save by avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and 2022. Second, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our financial expectations to take into account the favorable impact of tax reform at Energy Resources. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% at Energy Resources is significantly accretive to earnings. Due primarily to this favorable impact, tax reform is expected to increase NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS by roughly $0.45 in 2018. For 2018, our goal is to achieve our new $7.70 per share midpoint, which assumes we grow our 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.70 per share by 8% and add approximately $0.45 for the benefit of tax reform. Third, with the certainty provided by the new tax reform legislation and the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I'm also pleased to announce that we're extending NextEra Energy's financial expectations by 1 year, from 2020 to 2021. With this announcement, we now expect to be able to sustain the 6% to 8% per year growth in adjusted EPS off our revised 2018 midpoint of $7.70 per share through 2021, subject to our usual caveats. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. Tax reform is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flows for NextEra Energy as FPL uses tax savings to recover the Irma storm surcharges. Despite this, everything we see now suggests that our operating cash flow will continue to grow in line with our adjusted EPS growth range from 2018 through 2021. Overall, the tax reform outcome is positive and will immediately benefit FPL customers while being accretive to NextEra Energy shareholders. Fourth, we're advancing our renewable product offerings as we prepare for the next phase of renewable development. As a result, our prospects for new renewables growth have never been stronger. As expected, Congress did not make any retroactive changes to the PTC or ITC, which were each extended under a 5 year phasedown at the end of 2015. With incentives, wind is the cheapest form of energy at $0.012 to $0.018 per kilowatt hour at high wind sites, while solar continues to be priced at a discount to other forms of generation at $0.025 to $0.035 per kilowatt hour. Taken together, we continue to be in the best renewables environment in our history, as evidenced by our 2017 results. The ongoing cost declines in renewables are leading to increased economic demand from customers. Wind turbine technology continues to improve through a combination of taller towers and wider rotor diameters. Today, we're installing 127 meter rotor diameter turbines. By 2021, we expect manufacturers to be selling approximately 150 meter rotor diameter turbines in the U.S. market, further increasing net capacity factors and helping reduce installed wind costs on a dollar per kilowatt basis. Over the past year, we've seen an approximate 30% reduction in turbine costs. Through the end of the decade, we expect another 10% decline per year on average. As a result, we continue to expect that without incentives, early in the next decade, wind is going to be a $0.02 to $0.025 per kilowatt hour product. For solar, we continue to see rapid price declines and efficiency improvements. And we're well positioned to mitigate any impacts of the recently announced tariffs from the ITC 201 proceeding. As we previously discussed, before any tariffs were put in place, we purchased modules for our 2017 and 2018 build. We recently completed an additional order that covers our module needs for 2019 and a significant portion of our 2020 build. Ultimately, we expect that by 2020, as the tariff steps down, the market will have adjusted to these new dynamics. By early in the next decade, as further cost declines are realized and module efficiencies continue to improve, we expect that without incentives, solar will be $0.03 to $0.04 per kilowatt hour product, below the variable costs required to operate an existing coal or nuclear generating facility of $0.035 to $0.05 per kilowatt hour. As the world's current leader in wind, solar and storage development, we are uniquely positioned for the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution, to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource. We believe no other company has our expertise in all 3 products: wind, solar and battery storage, to leverage the combined technologies at the low cost we can achieve. In fact, we recently submitted a bid at a very competitive price for a combined wind, solar and battery storage product that is able to provide an around the clock, new firm, shaped product specifically designed to meet the customers' needs. By leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, including our development skills; purchasing power; best in class construction expertise; resource assessment capabilities; strong access to and cost of capital advantages; and the ability to combine wind, solar and battery storage solutions together, we remain well positioned to capture a meaningful and growing share of the renewables market going forward. Finally, in addition to increasing and extending our financial expectations and having what I believe to be the best opportunity set in our industry, we continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. Through the sale of noncore assets over the last 2 years, including FiberNet and our Forney, Lamar and Marcus Hook gas generation assets, we've recycled almost $4 billion of capital while advancing our strategy to become more long term contracted and rate regulated. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and enhanced business risk profile, SP and Moody's recently announced favorable adjustments to our credit metric thresholds. While SP has already reduced our FFO to debt rating trigger to 23% from 26%, yesterday, Moody's announced its plan to reduce NextEra Energy's CFO preworking capital to debt rating threshold from 20% to 18% if the regulated contribution to our business mix continues to improve to approximately 70% over time. Based on this level of regulated contribution, we would also expect a further reduction to our FFO to debt rating trigger from SP. At our current thresholds of 23% and 20% at SP and Moody's, respectively, we currently expect to have $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity that can be utilized through 2021 to either buy back shares or opportunistically execute on profitable incremental capital investments or profitable acquisition opportunities if it makes sense to do so. Our excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations. Today's announcements set the foundation for growth over the next 4 years. While there certainly will be challenges that we'll have to manage due to the overall strength and diversity of our opportunity set, I will be disappointed if we're not able to continue to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range while, at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects, and today's announcements for NextEra Energy are a reflection of that enthusiasm. I'll now turn the call over to John to provide the detailed results.     Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year overall. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $6.70, up 8.2% from 2016, while continuing to make excellent progress on our major growth initiatives. FPL grew regulatory capital employed approximately 10.3% year over year as we continued investing in new and modernized generation as well as a stronger and smarter grid to further improve the already outstanding efficiency and reliability of our system. All of our major capital initiatives, including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the Eastern U.S., remain on track. In 2017, FPL continued executing on its outstanding customer value proposition, delivering its best ever service reliability performance while maintaining a typical customer bill that is more than 25% below the national average and the lowest among the top 10 investor owned utilities by market cap. As Jim mentioned earlier, 2017 was the best period for new wind and solar origination in our history. The Energy Resources team added more than 2,700 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog, including the largest combined solar and storage facility in the United States announced to date and roughly 700 megawatts of additional wind repowering to our backlog. Over the course of the year, we commissioned roughly 2,150 megawatts of wind and solar projects in the U.S., including the first approximately 1,600 megawatts of our repowering program. All in all, 2017 was a terrific year of execution at FPL and Energy Resources. Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2017, FPL reported GAAP net income of $344 million or $0.73 per share. FPL's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which excludes a tax reform related item that I will discuss in a moment, were $394 million or $0.84 per share, an increase of $23 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year over year. For the full year 2017, FPL reported GAAP earnings of $1.88 billion or $3.98 per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.93 billion or $4.09 per share. Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the specific tax reform impacts to FPL. For the fourth quarter, FPL is excluding from adjusted earnings the $50 million after tax net impact that results primarily from the shortfall of available reserve amortization to offset the Irma cost recovery expense. This tax reform related item reduced our reported ROE for regulatory purposes to approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ended December 2017. For the full year 2018, we expect tax savings to begin restoring our reserve amortization balance. And coupled with our weather normalized sales forecast and current CapEx and OM expectations, we expect to target a regulatory ROE of 11.6%. Based upon our historic pattern of underlying revenues and expenses, we do not expect that the tax savings will fully offset our typical reserve amortization requirements for the first half of 2018, causing FPL to initially earn below our 11.6% target regulatory ROE. We expect FPL to earn a regulatory ROE towards the middle of a range of roughly 10.4% to 10.8% in the first quarter and roughly 10.7% to 11.1% in the second quarter before returning to more normal levels in the third and fourth quarter, all on a trailing 12 month basis and subject to our normal caveats. So while this will result in some lumpiness in our quarterly expectations, we do not expect it to impact our full year results. During the fourth quarter, FPL was required to revalue its deferred income tax liabilities to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The majority of the reduction in income tax liability, totaling approximately $4.5 billion, has been reclassified to a regulatory liability that we expect will be amortized over the underlying assets' remaining useful lives. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.3% for 2017 and was the principal driver of FPL's adjusted EPS growth of 10.2% for the full year. FPL built upon key successes from 2016, again being recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the Southeast. At the same time, FPL's typical customer bill has remained well below both state and national averages. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $5.3 billion. Each of our ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well. We were pleased to complete construction of the first 4 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers, governed by the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement, on schedule and under budget. An additional 4 solar sites, totaling nearly 300 megawatts, are currently on track to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers later this quarter. We also continue to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have secured potential sites that could support more than 5 gigawatts of FPL's ongoing solar expansion. This month, we completed the early retirement of the St. Johns River Power Park, an approximately 1,300 megawatt coal fired plant co owned with JEA. Construction on the approximately 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget. Additionally, progress on the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through the regulatory approval process. Continued smart investments such as these will allow FPL to deliver on its outstanding customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and superior customer service, and are expected to support a compound annual growth rate in regulatory capital employed of approximately 8% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021. The economy in Florida remains healthy. The current unemployment rate of 3.7% remains below the national average and near the lowest levels in a decade. Florida's consumer confidence level remains near 10 year highs. The real estate sector also continues to show strength, with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the Case Shiller Index for South Florida home prices up 4.4% from the prior year. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales increased 0.5% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that weather related usage per customer contributed approximately 1.2% to this amount. On a weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales declined 0.7% as ongoing customer growth was more than offset by a decline in weather normalized usage per customer. For 2017, we estimate that FPL's retail sales benefited from a positive year over year impact of 1.7% from weather, which is partially offset by a decline of 0.9% as a result of the net effects of Hurricanes Matthew and Irma. After accounting for these factors and the 2016 leap year impact, FPL's 2017 retail sales on a weather normalized basis declined by 1.6%, which was primarily driven by a reduction in underlying usage per customer, partially offset by customer growth. While the recent trend in underlying usage is below our long term expectations, we have not yet drawn any firm conclusions. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls. Modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings while we operate under the current settlement agreement as we will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect, which is expected to allow FPL to maintain its target regulatory ROE. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year 2017 GAAP earnings of $2.963 billion or $6.27 per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.23 billion or $2.61 per share, reflecting roughly 12% year over year growth. For the fourth quarter, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.894 billion or $4 per share and adjusted earnings of $230 million or $0.49 per share. This quarter's adjusted results excluded 2 items: a gain related to revaluing deferred income tax liabilities that I will discuss in a moment, and a charge associated with our Duane Arnold Energy Center. For Duane Arnold, in the latter part of 2017, we concluded that it is unlikely that the facility's primary customer will extend the current contract after it expires in 2025. Without a contract extension, we will likely close the facility at the end of 2025 despite being licensed to operate until 2034. As a result, during the fourth quarter, Duane Arnold's book value and asset retirement obligation were reviewed, and an after tax impairment of $258 million was recorded that reflects our belief it is unlikely the project will operate after 2025. That being said, we will continue to pursue a contract extension that would enable Duane Arnold to continue operations. Duane Arnold's contribution to Energy Resources net income has been and is expected to be negligible over the next several years. As a result of tax reform, Energy Resources was required to revalue its deferred income tax liability to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. This $1.925 billion reduction in income tax liability provided an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter, which has been excluded from adjusted earnings. Based upon our strong banking relationships and our position as the #1 renewables developer, we remain confident that our access to tax equity will remain robust. As an example, following the signing of the tax reform legislation, we were able to close our 4 remaining 2017 tax equity financings, totaling more than $1 billion in proceeds at economics substantially similar to what was expected before tax reform. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter increased by $0.08 versus the prior year comparable period. This primarily reflects contributions from new investments and increased contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of repowering, partially offset by lower contributions from our gas infrastructure business due to the absence of the Texas pipelines' earnout adjustment that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.28 or approximately 12% year over year. Growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio, including the roughly 2,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects that we commissioned in 2016, which are included in new investments during the first 12 months of their operation. In total, new renewables investments added $0.67 per share. Contributions from new natural gas pipeline investments added $0.10 per share. Partially offsetting new investment growth was a decline of $0.11 per share in contributions from our existing generation assets, the majority of which is attributable to the sale of the Lamar, Forney and Marcus Hook natural gas fired generating assets in 2016. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business declined by $0.19 per share, $0.16 of which is attributable to the absence of the earnout adjustment that was recognized for the Texas pipelines in 2016. All of the other effects had a negative impact of $0.19 per share, mostly driven by a year over year increase in interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. In 2017, Energy Resources advanced its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have signed contracts for 736 megawatts of new renewables projects, including 512 megawatts of wind and 224 megawatts of solar. With today's announced contracts, our 2017 and 2018 wind backlog is now nearly 2,000 megawatts. With visibility to several hundred megawatts of additional projects for 2018, we continue to believe that we can achieve the range of expectations that we have previously provided for 2017 and 2018. For 2019 and 2020, we are already just below the range of expectations that we have provided for solar. And for U.S. wind, our current backlog is already almost half of the low end of our expected range. Additionally, our total current backlog of almost 7,000 megawatts, including repowering for 2017 through 2020, is the largest for a 4 year period in Energy Resources' history. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. Beyond renewables, 2017 was an excellent year for Energy Resources' natural gas pipeline activities. During the year, both the Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection natural gas pipeline projects successfully achieved commercial operation on budget and on schedule. The Mountain Valley Pipeline also made excellent progress over the year, receiving its first limited notice to proceed from FERC earlier this week, and we remain on track to achieve a year end 2018 commercial operations date. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.155 billion or $4.55 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $590 million or $1.25 per share, respectively. For the full year 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $5.378 billion or $11.38 per share. Adjusted earnings were $3   $3.165 billion or $6.70 per share. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow, adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition, increased by almost 15% year over year. During the fourth quarter, we were able to capitalize on the ongoing favorable market conditions and completed all of the refinancing initiatives we were considering as of the third quarter call. These combined financings, which have roughly $165 million of after tax NPV savings on a cash basis, resulted in net income reduction of approximately $33 million when they closed in the fourth quarter. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.15 per share compared to 2016, primary reflecting the impact of these refinancing costs. Turning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy. As Jim discussed, we are increasing the range of our adjusted EPS expectations and increase   and extending our long term growth outlook. We now expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2021, off a revised base of the midpoint of our new 2018 range, or $7.70 per share. Additional details of our revised expectations are shown in the accompanying slide. For 2018, while we target the new $7.70 midpoint of our range, we expect that the majority of the growth will come in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of the year, FPL is expected to earn below its regulatory ROE of 11.6% as we do not expect that the tax savings will immediately offset our typical reserve amortization requirements. This will present a headwind to adjusted EPS growth during the first quarter, with stronger growth expected for the balance of the year as the regulatory ROE on a trailing 12 month basis increases towards our target 11.6% level by the second half of the year. During the period of our financial expectations, we expect the interest on all NextEra Energy's debt to continue to be fully tax deductible at the 21% federal corporate income tax rate despite the limit on interest deductibility in the tax reform legislation. As a reminder, due to the NEP governance changes that we implemented in 2017, NextEra Energy is required to deconsolidate NEP from its financial statements beginning January 1, 2018. These changes will be reflected in our first quarter financial results. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. We expect the board of NextEra Energy to determine the dividend policy for beyond 2018 at our next regularly scheduled board meeting in February, and we will make an announcement about the outcome of that   of their decision at that time. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NEP. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.405 per common unit or $1.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2017. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD increased approximately 18% and 12% year over year, respectively. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% while CAFD was up 11% from 2016. In regards to the impacts of tax reform for NextEra Energy Partners, NEP recorded a $101 million charge related to revaluating its deferred income taxes to the new 21% corporate income tax rate in the fourth quarter. The duration of NEP's income tax shield, which we have previously said is greater than 15 years, will remain better than 15 years following tax reform. Additionally, the expectation that NEP runs a negative earnings and profit or EP balance for at least the next 8 years also remains unchanged. With no adverse impacts to NEP's tax shields or the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment, NEP remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition. NEP's fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $199 million increased $31 million from a year earlier. Fourth quarter CAFD was approximately $76 million, an increase of $8 million year over year, which was driven primarily by NEP's strong portfolio growth, with a relatively modest offset from higher fees. Wind resource returned to normal after a weak third quarter as overall wind resource was 102% of the long term average during the fourth quarter. The appendix of today's presentation includes a slide with additional details regarding 2017 wind resource for the NEP portfolio. For full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $743 million and $246 million, up 16% and 11%, respectively, driven primarily by growth of the underlying portfolio. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. The NEP portfolio as of year end 2017 supports adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run rates in line with the expectations we have shared previously for December 31, 2017. Since the federal income tax rate declined from 35% to 21%, the resulting pretax value of NEP's tax credits, which are calculated by dividing 1 minus the tax rate, changes as well. While tax reform impacts the calculation of NEP's adjusted EBITDA, it has no effect on cash available for distribution. Our previous December 31, 2017, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million are now $830 million to $930 million as a result of this change. The December 31, 2017, run rate range for CAFD of $310 million to $340 million remains unchanged. Our previously announced December 31, 2018, run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2018 for adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion to $1.2 billion are now $1 billion to $1.15 billion as a result of tax reform. The December 31, 2018, run rate range for CAFD of $360 million to $400 million is unchanged. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an ongoing operating expense. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2018 distribution that is payable in February 2019 to be in a range of $1.81 to $1.86 per common unit. Tax reform has highlighted several optimization opportunities within NEP's international portfolio, which we continue to evaluate. One such opportunity that we are exploring is the potential sale of the Canadian portfolio, which could enable the partnership to recycle capital back into U.S. assets, which benefit from a longer federal income tax shield, allowing NEP to retain more CAFD in the future for every dollar invested. We would only execute on such a transaction if it were accretive to NEP's long term growth runway to do so, potentially positioning the partnership to extend its financial expectations and need for common equity. If we decide to move forward, we will update you on the progress of our efforts over the coming months. With the IDR restructuring, governance enhancements, financing flexibility, competitive cost of capital and visible prospects for future growth in place, we are pleased with NEP's execution during 2017. Heading into 2018 and beyond, NEP is as well positioned as it's ever been to deliver its long term financial expectations and best in class investor value proposition. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.\",\n          \"        Thank you, Suzanne. Hi, everyone, and welcome to EA's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me from their homes today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings, our earnings release, our financial model and our earnings slides are available at ir.ea.com. We will post an audio replay, a copy of these prepared remarks and a transcript after the call. With regards to our calendar, our Q1 fiscal 2021 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, July 30, 2020. Many of the usual opportunities we have to meet with investors, such as conferences, are unavailable at this time. We're building out a program of virtual tours to reach as many of you as possible over the coming weeks and months directly and through partnering with sell side analysts. This presentation and our comments include forward looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. And note in particular that these forward looking statements may be affected by risks related to the COVID 19 pandemic. We refer you to our most recent Form 10 Q and our earnings release for a discussion of risks, including those related to COVID 19, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 5, 2020, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.     Thanks, Chris. This is a challenging time for everyone. As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We're here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus, first and foremost, has been on the health and well being of our teams and their families during the COVID 19 situation. I'll start by sharing a little about our actions to support our employees around the world. We have an internal COVID 19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events and close our Shanghai and Seoul facilities. By mid March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we've put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have everything they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay at home orders and physical distancing. We continue to be in a work from home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We're planning for the return to take place over an extended period, and we make   as we make longer term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward. Moving to our results. We finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings above our previously raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I'll touch on a few examples from the year. EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world. With approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far with VOLTA opening up an entirely new dimension of the game and FIFA Ultimate Team continue to grow as the most popular mode. FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations. Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history. Apex Legends was the most downloaded free to play game on PS4 in 2019 and continues to grow as an innovative long term service for players. It's been continually recognized as one of the best multi player experiences available. And with each new season of content, Respawn had been delivering more of what players love from lore to new legends to in game events. Before COVID 19 stay at home orders began, season 4 was already outperforming each of the 2 prior seasons, and the Old Ways Event in April has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately 2x the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the breakout titles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for a first title in an entirely new franchise. It's a meticulously well crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply engaging and original Star Wars experience. The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else in the market, and FY '20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in the Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests. With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rise in usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We're humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time, in part, has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams and our technology investments across the company. For more than 5 years, we've been investing in a single technology infrastructure architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That's enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity. But the real story is the people of Electronics Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They've come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we have been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date. We've had a deep focus on our players through this time, our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content, the NFL Draft and new additions to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our stay at home play together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter in place orders began to take effect in March. Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we've delivered dozens of stay and play programs to date from special community live streams and giveaways to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our sports teams launched a fully cloud based broadcasting platform that allows us to produce high quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff all safely at home. We've since conducted major online tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay and Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID 19 relief that brought together top European clubs and footballers and aired in more than 100 countries. We've now executed or plan to execute in the coming months more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events. The global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we've increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities, from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment for health care workers to food drives and much more, and we're supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts in making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we've responded well to this global challenge, and we're in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content and supporting our communities when and where they need it most. Looking to FY '21, we are growing our portfolio of high quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 40 new titles to play this fiscal year. That includes 4 new EA SPORTS titles, FIFA, Madden, NHL and 1 more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next generation consoles this year, and we're excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon. Our FY '21 plans also include 4 more games drawing on the breadth of our IP from Command  Conquer Remastered to unannounced games for console and PC. We'll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA partners and 2 new mobile titles leveraging top IP that will bring to players worldwide. With our team's expertise in live services, we're also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience. In addition, our new EA SPORTS games will continue delivering fans daily connection to sports through our live services even if the real world leagues and teams aren't back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content to FIFA Online and Apex Legends in Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones. This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and ways to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We'll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam, and we're also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year. As we begin FY '21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as COVID 19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners and long term impacts to our productivity in a global work from home environment are among the areas we will be watching closely and could affect both player behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned time lines. We are thankful for the extraordinary people that we have Electronic Arts and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities and our company. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake.     Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I'd like to focus on the impacts we're seeing in our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and well being of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven't yet solved all those problems. But for example, we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event. Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch, and we expect to see the next Sims expansion; and Command  Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA. Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you've heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we've seen a corresponding large rise in live service revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter proved the value of the live service path that we've been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this to meet player needs in a variety of ways. The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games with sales actually above where we would have expected them to be at this time of the year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009 compared to only 20% last year. Turning to our results. I'll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically reported non GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion; cost of revenue, $1.37 billion. Operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including onetime tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion. Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year on year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year on year driven by strength across our business. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than what we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slide for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter end, we have completed our 2 year $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty of the markets and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution. Our business today is extremely strong. Our cash and short term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes with $600 million maturing in March 2021 and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than the fiscal 2020 free cash flow. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion with the beat versus expectations driven by The Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represent 78% of our business on a trailing 12 month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were $789 million. The year on year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly throughout fiscal 2020. Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year on year driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year driven by the launch of Anthem in the year ago quarter partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year. Looking ahead to the next 12 months. We are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we're providing to our players through live services and the new games we have on our slate. The market outlook is uncertain, but we're basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid single digits in calendar 2020 with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are continuing   are currently performing extremely well, it's not yet known when professional sports might resume nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are providing to be popular competitive outlets for football, soccer and hockey fans. There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games, and the guidance I'm about to provide is predicting   are predicted on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY '21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third party studios, which will be announced in the coming quarters. We're not seeing material impact on our FY '21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third party titles where we have less control. Finally, with regard to potential impacts of a recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss 3 changes we are making with regards to our reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees instead of net to align with industry practice. Finally, we're updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We've published more details on our IR website. Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue at $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember, fiscal '20's GAAP EPS included a onetime tax benefit of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%. With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year on year with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes and higher variable compensation and lower interest income. Turning to business drivers. We anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year on year on a like for like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties induced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020. And full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year on year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2001 (sic) [2021], up 1% on a like for like basis. On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% during fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense controls in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we're seeing very strong engagement in net bookings growth to date, we're only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay at home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control. Thus, we're taking a more cautious view than normal. As usual, we have presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year, the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We've made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing, but it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition. I'll finish by personally thanking everybody at the company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to deliver games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you. With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew.     Thanks, Blake. We feel very fortunate at Electronic Arts to have the opportunity to bring games and entertainment to people around the world. That's true every day, but it's especially true during his unprecedented situation. Our ability to fulfill important motivations to players, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, creation and learning has brought more people to connect and spend time in our games in the recent weeks and months of COVID 19 stay at home orders. We've seen games be a source of joy for hundreds of millions of players. We will now look to be delivering for these players for a long time to come. Our focus continues to be on delivering great games and content through the breadth and depth of our portfolio in our ongoing live services and by connecting more players through our games via more distribution channels and platforms. With the incredible determination of our teams, we've been able to keep producing new experiences from our homes around the world. And as we continue to work through this global challenge, we plan to continue delivering a lot of new games, new experiences and exciting ways to play this year. How we live, work and play will undoubtedly be changed by the COVID 19 pandemic. We're humbled that games have been part of how people are coming together. We'll continue to serve our people, our players and our local communities by helping them in any way that we can. To everyone listening into this call, please be safe and be well. Now Blake and I are here for your questions.\",\n          \"    Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. My name is Abbey, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.     Thank you, Abbey, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we get started, please note that our comments today will include forward looking statements that are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current expectations. And we also make references to non GAAP results, which exclude special items. And for more information regarding forward looking statements and our reconciliations of non GAAP to GAAP results, please visit our Investor Relations section of southwest.com, where you can find this morning's earnings release as well as our SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Gary.     Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for an excellent third quarter performance. It was a very nice recovery from the second quarter, which was down 3% on a RASM basis due to Flight 1380, and then that was a nice turnaround to the third quarter RASM performance of up 1.2%. Mexico was weak for us in terms of revenue. But our domestic performance, excluding all the international, the domestic performance was a solid RASM of plus 2.3% year over year, and it's 2.9% if you adjust for stage and gauge increases. Overall, we had a sequential quarter over quarter improvement of 2 percentage points ahead of normal trends. So again, it was a very nice recovery. Year over year comps always have noise in them, but I'm expecting another sequential trend improvement in fourth quarter and then a year over year improvement as we said in the press release of 1% to 2%. So again, that would be another nice, better than trend sequential improvement if we do that. Our unit cost ex items will come in roughly flat to up 1% for the year, and for the fourth quarter for that matter, but another excellent cost performance. We wanted to provide you an early look ahead to 2019. Our confidence level forecasting revenues is never 100%, of course, and especially looking a year out, but our goal for next year right now is positive RASM, and of at least 3%. And while it is a goal, trends and initiatives that we already have underway would support that goal. Our confidence level in predicting cost is much higher, of course, than revenues. And based on the planning that's currently underway, the preliminary read is that unit cost ex items will also be up at least 3%. I'm not satisfied with that as I'm sure our investors aren't either, and Tammy will describe the cost pressures further, but I did want to provide some perspective first. Just looking across the last decade plus, we've committed to strategic initiatives and invested accordingly. Some investments were revenue generating. Some investments were capacity and growth related. Some investments were efficiency related. But as a consequence of that strategy and those investments, the airline has been transformed, and the costs during this intervening time period have been well controlled. And to do that, we relied primarily on fleet modernization to accomplish that. We have a stronger, much more prosperous but a more complex airline. In some cases, there are costs associated with driving these higher revenues. But the main point that I want to make is that our focus with our strategic efforts has clearly been on transforming the airline and driving more revenue along with operational reliability and customer service. And I'm very pleased with the results of all those efforts. The results must be sustained and continuously improved from here. But eventually, I think all of us at Southwest knew that the time would come where our initiatives would need to zero in on efficiency and productivity and just overall cost control. And clearly, that time has arrived, and cost will be our #1 priority. So the basic inflationary themes that Tammy is going to talk about, we constantly battle. We're investing in airport infrastructure. We're investing in technology initiatives and projects. Aircraft maintenance is an ever increasing burden. And then there is just natural salaries, wages and benefits inflation. So the opportunities to offset that natural inflation are what you would expect. It lies in modernizing our fleet, just the overall quality of our flight schedule, continuing to drive operational efficiency, controlling our GA spending, and then from there, of course, we just rely on individual department missions. So for 2019, at this preliminary juncture, while we're seeing the known cost pressures, we aren't yet seeing the productivity offsets. There are offsets in fuel because of fuel efficiency, which, of course, aren't showing up in the cost ex fuel items, but we're not seeing enough productivity offsets yet. So speaking plainly, it will take more focus on our part and more effort on our part to make that happen. And as I've already said, that's where our focus will be. And we may have to de prioritize some other yearned for things that we have in the meantime. I'll also point out that many of our efficiencies already underway will, again, will show up in jet fuel consumption. And we'll need to clearly identify that for you as offsets in the future. So we have a challenge, and we always do, by the way. We always have challenges. We're very well prepared and very well positioned. Number one, we have a very strong balance sheet with declining leverage, and it's below 30%. We have very strong liquidity with cash levels well ahead of our target. We just reported record earnings for the quarter. And barring the unforeseen, we expect very strong year over year earnings growth in the fourth quarter. We have an outstanding fuel hedge that's built for the next 24 months. We have very manageable growth plans for 2019. And in fact, we need growth to absorb investments that were made related to capacity like airports and training facilities. Our operations are excellent. Our brand and our customer ratings are very high and industry leading. Our culture, of course, is unmatched, and our ability to attract talented people in this flowing employment environment is very strong. And then finally, and I think most importantly, we have a low cost DNA. We have a proven track record of managing not just cost, but industry leading profits and margins and returns. And in the meantime, again, assuming nothing unforeseen, we will continue our focus on excellent shareholder returns. So with that hopefully helpful perspective, let me just turn the call over to Tom Nealon to take us through the commercial side here.     Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everybody. Well, as Gary said, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, and we are seeing continued strength into the fourth quarter in terms of passenger demand throughout the booking curve as well as continued strength in the pricing environment and very solid yield amounts. So we're very pleased with that. And before getting into the fourth quarter, let me walk you through the performance in the [tiers] of the third quarter. I'll try and tie that back to my comments from the July call. So as you know, we ended the third quarter with a record $5.6 billion in operating revenues, which is up about 5% year over year. And our passenger yields increased 2.3% for the quarter. So again, we're very pleased with that. Our load factor was 83.9%, which was down about 1 point year over year. But we actually saw passenger growth of 2.5% for the quarter, and we carried a record 33.9 million passengers in the third quarter. So we're very pleased with the strength of passenger demand as well as the strength of the pricing environment, and I think our teams did a phenomenal job of balancing our yields and load factors for a very well balanced strong result. So that's all good. I shared with you all in July, going into the quarter, we knew that we had 3 RASM headwinds, which altogether were a 2 point drag on Q3 RASM. First, we had the Rapid Rewards accounting change, which was 1 point. Second, we had about 0.5 point of drag from our summer fare sale, which was part of our 1380 recovery as you'll recall. And third, we expected about 0.5 point drag resulting from the suboptimal schedule, which was tied to the shoulder flying and the fleet retirement and such. These headwinds materialized as we expected in the third quarter, which again was 2 points of RASM headwinds. And also as expected, we do not see them repeating in the fourth quarter. In our mid September update, we made a positive revision to our Q3 RASM outlook from an outlook of roughly flat to RASM increasing in the 1% to 1.5% range. Our third quarter RASM came in right in line with our latest guidance, and we finished the quarter up 1.2% year over year. And there were really 2 primary drivers of our improved Q3 RASM result compared to our original guidance in July. So first, we had about 2,200 total flight cancellations due to weather during the quarter, and that resulted in about 0.5 point of RASM benefit for the quarter. The weather events were primarily severe storms in late July and early August, and it was very concentrated in Denver and Baltimore, where we obviously have very large, very complex operations. So that was significant. Conversely though, we only saw a few hundred cancellations due to hurricane Florence, and the RASM impact of Florence was really immaterial for us. Second and more importantly and more interesting, we saw strong improvements in our passenger yield trends, in particular, with close in bookings, which resulted in a little more than 0.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM. Our new revenue management tools and techniques also contributed to our yield performance and solid RASM results. So for the third quarter, we realized an EBIT benefit of approximately $75 million, which was right in line with our expectations, which is roughly a 1.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM. Now this benefit was driven primarily by our new OD revenue management capabilities, but we also saw meaningful benefit from our new pricing capabilities as well. So we are very happy, very, very happy with the performance of our new res system and revenue management capabilities. And we are achieving the benefits that we signed up for and committed to. So in terms of our ancillary revenue performance, we had another really good quarter. As I'm sure you saw in late August, we introduced the new pricing structure for our EarlyBird product, where we moved from a fixed $15 one way price point to price points of $15, $20 and $25, and the price points are based on a combination of length of haul and EarlyBird demand by market. So it's still early, but so far, we've been very pleased with the results. The take rates are right in line with our expectations, which not only results in incremental revenue, but also allows us to better manage the number of priority boarding positions sold on each flight, which makes the product that much more valuable to our customers. Our Rapid Rewards program, well, it continues to strengthen and grow as well as our business partner revenues, and these categories were again the primary drivers of the 6.6% growth in other revenues in Q3. We are counting   or continuing to see strong growth in new Rapid Rewards credit card members as well as strength in credit card spending, both of which were up again double digits year over year. And while it's early, our new credit card, which launched in Q3, is also performing very well and is also in line with our expectations. The net of all this is that we had a very strong third quarter. We are very pleased with how our new tools and our new products are performing. Now let's move on to the fourth quarter. Looking forward, as I said earlier, we are seeing continued revenue strength into the fourth quarter. Our year over year capacity growth is planned in the 6% to 6.5% range, which is 2.5 points higher than in Q3. And despite that, we are, in fact, expecting a sequential improvement in our year over year RASM performance in Q4 as Gary said. As I mentioned, I think we'll have a clean year over year RASM comparison. So based on our current bookings and yield trends, we expect Q4 RASM to increase in the range of 1% to 2% year over year. Our base business trends continue to be very strong throughout the booking curve. Our passenger yield expectations are, once again, being aided by benefits from OD revenue managements and our new pricing capabilities. And based on the bookings so far, fourth quarter demand appears to be very, very solid and holding up very nicely. So again, we do expect to see some load factor decline, but the net effect should continue to be a positive for RASM performance. We do expect the year over year EBIT benefit of $80 million to $90 million in Q4 from our new res system, which gets us to an estimated 1.5 point benefit to Q4 RASM. And that puts us right in line with our annual 2018 EBIT goal of $200 million from our new res system. I'll tell you, I'm very proud of how our revenue management capabilities were delivered on time and on plan, and they are working exactly as they were designed. I think the commercial and technology teams did an awesome job. I couldn't be more proud and more pleased and more thankful with the quality of the execution and the results. So in terms of our shoulder flying, as expected, we began to reduce our shoulder flying beginning in Q3, and the reduction continues into Q4. In particular, we did reduce our deep shoulder flying, and this is flying that's before 6:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. just as a reminder. And with this reduction in deep shoulder flying, we are not seeing a RASM drag in Q4 from our schedule, and we expect deep shoulder flying to subside further as we move into 2019. So to wrap it up, I am very pleased with trends that we're seeing in the back half of 2018. And as Gary said, barring any unforeseen events, this sets us up very well and very nicely as we head into 2019. And finally, we are very, very anxious, very eager for our upcoming launch to Hawaii, and we are ready to go with our flight schedules once we receive the necessary approvals. So with that, I will turn it over to Mike Van de Ven for our operations update.     Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon to some of you all and morning to others. As you guys know, the third quarter is a transition period for the operation, and we began the quarter with a very heavy summer flying. We had just over 4,000 flights a day in the beginning of the quarter, and we ended up in late August and September time frame with just under that amount. And the operation is often impacted in this period by a combination of high load factor and weather, and this year, it just wasn't any different. We had a tough last half of July and early August with 2,200 weather related cancellations that Tom mentioned. And in addition to those cancellations though, we experienced more weather related ATC and [balk] delays this July than we have in any July over the last 10 years. So despite that difficult environment, our people were just, they were magnificent. And I think we delivered a superb operational performance for the quarter. We expect to finish fourth in the DOT on time performance for the quarter, and that's based on marketing carrier results. And that's an improvement of 3 spots over last year. We set a third quarter record for the lowest percentage of mishandled bags in our history. And our DOT complaints that have been reported through August are at 5 year lows and are down 24.5% from last year. And just as a reminder, we were #1 in the industry last year. And our fuel efficiency, as Gary mentioned, continues to grow in terms of the ASMs we've produced per gallon. And we're improving at about 1.1%. And again, that's primarily as a result of our fleet modernization efforts. So we've had very strong operational results in terms of reliability and hospitality. I think that will continue into the fourth quarter. And we're going to spend more time, as Gary mentioned, focusing towards our efficiency and cost opportunities as we move forward. A couple other highlights in the third quarter. We announced that we are partnering with the State of Maryland to build a maintenance hangar in Baltimore. That's going to house 3 Boeing 737s inside the hangar and will also provide us with additional parking spots of up to 8 airplanes overnight. That's our first hangar in the Northeast, and it's a really a needed addition to one of our busiest cities. We've also previously announced our intent to add both a pilot and a flight attendant crew base in Los Angeles, and those will be opening up here in December and the first part of next year. And that will, in part, support our Hawaii efforts. And then speaking of Hawaii, it's our expansion focus for next year. And just subject to the timing of our ETOPS certification from the FAA, our goal continues still to be to sell tickets at the end of this year and operate flights early next year. So with that brief update, Tammy, I think I'll just turn it over to you.     Right. Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Moving right into cost. Our third quarter CASM, excluding special items, increased 4.1% year over year, driven in part by a nearly 9% increase in our hedged fuel cost. Our hedged fuel price per gallon remains steady at $2.25, and that's despite an increase in market jet fuel prices during the quarter. Our hedged jet fuel remains in line with our guidance due to more material hedging gains that kicked in at higher prices. The $0.04 net hedge benefit consisted of $0.10 of hedging gains, offset by $0.06 of premium costs. For fourth quarter and based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.30 to $2.35 range. This guidance includes an estimated $0.07 net hedging benefit, including $0.14 of hedging gains, offset by $0.07 of premium costs. The $0.10 sequential increase in our estimated fourth quarter fuel price normalizing for the hedging gain is largely due to the increase in market prices. For 2019, we are also well prepared with a 63% hedge in protection beginning at $70 Brent crude equivalent with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and continue to increase well above $100 per barrel. Our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in market price declines. For full year 2019, based on market prices last Friday and our current hedging positions, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.35 to $2.40 range, with an estimated $0.08 hedging gain and $0.04 premium cost. We expect 2019 fuel hedge premium costs, which is included in fuel and oil expense, to be approximately $80 million or $0.04 per gallon, down from this year. As Mike said, we continue to benefit from increased fuel efficiency from our fleet modernization. Our third quarter available seat mile per gallon, which is our key fuel efficiency metric, improved by 1.1% year over year. As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly behind our 2018 goal of 2% to 3%, primarily due to our utilization of the  700 fleet to cover our fleet deficit and suboptimal flight schedule. As our schedule becomes more optimized and as we take on more MAX aircraft to begin the retirement cycle of the 700s, we expect the fuel efficiency profile of our fleet to continue to improve. In fact, I expect sequential improvement in our fourth quarter year over year fuel efficiency more in line with what we were expecting for the full year. I'm going to move on to third and fourth quarter nonfuel costs, and I'll talk in more detail about 2019 at the end of my prepared remarks. When you strip out fuel, profit sharing and special items, our unit cost inflation in third quarter was in line with our expectations. As we previously disclosed in our investor update, our third quarter unit costs were impacted by weather related flight cancellations, resulting in about a 1 point reduction in ASM. When combined with modest weather related costs, the flight cancellations resulted in a nearly 1 point year over year negative impact to CASM. We ended up at the lower end of our CASM guidance, primarily due to approximately $10 million of spending that shifted into the fourth quarter and beyond. The shifts are primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and technology spending. Aside from shifting, the other cost categories were pretty much in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter year over year CASM outlook looks good, particularly from the easier comparisons that we had with last year's tax reform year end bonus. Despite some cost pressure from shifting of spend out of the first half and third quarter, fourth quarter year over year CASM, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing, is expected to be flat to up 1%. We've also had some capacity cuts here in fourth quarter, so we do have some related cost pressures. Netting out the moving parts, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, remains unchanged. Our balance sheet remains very strong and investment grade credit ratings and with ample liquidity. And we also have very healthy cash flows. Our year to date operating cash flow was $3.9 billion. We've invested $1.4 billion back into the business thus far in 2018. And for full year 2018 CapEx, we continue to expect to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range. And we are planning for a similar level of CapEx for 2019. So far in 2018, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $332 million in dividends. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched in third quarter and just completed earlier this month. This most recent ASR completed our previous $2 billion share repurchase authorization and the first $150 million from our new $2 billion authorization. So we have $1.85 billion remaining. Over the past 5 years, we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends, supporting our commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders. So overall, I'm very pleased with our continued approach to capital deployment with appropriate balance. We intend to continue investing back in the business while focusing on opportunities to drive further value. And we continue to have great opportunities to do so, in particular, with further investments in fleet modernization. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we also intend to continue returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with our excess cash. Regarding our fleet plan, we made some slight tweaks to our order book recently. First, as planned, we took delivery of 5 Boeing 737 800 aircraft and 7 MAX 8s in the quarter, and we continue to expect to end the year with 751 aircraft. During third quarter, we signed leases on an additional 4 MAX 8 aircraft with delivery in 2019. We still have 27 firm orders from Boeing for 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 aircraft next year. And now we have 7 leased MAX 8s coming next year as well for a total of 34 aircraft in 2019. As we've previously shared, we're planning to designate some of our 737 700 aircraft for retirement next year to support our continued investment in fleet modernization. These additional aircraft acquisitions are in a future opportunities to pick up a few additional new aircraft for fleet replacement do not change our previously communicated 2019 capacity plan. On the capacity side, with the storm cancellations in the third quarter, we are now planning for our 2018 capacity to increase approximately 4% with fourth quarter ASMs up in the 6% to 6.5% range year over year. And we continue to plan for 2019 capacity to increase no more than 5% year over year, which is unchanged. Our schedule is currently published through early June 2019, and they exclude expected Hawaii flying. You can see that excluding Hawaii, our January through May year over year ASM growth is modest. In regard to 2019 cost and as Gary mentioned, we are expecting full year 2019 CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, to increase at least 3% year over year. The key drivers of our year over year unit cost pressures in 2019 are primarily due to operations, staffing demands and health care inflation, which is driving an increase in salary, wages and benefits; increased maintenance expense, driven in part by expected timing of maintenance events; airport cost increases, driven in part by airport infrastructure investments; and continued heavy investments in technology, focused primarily on operational investments. Much of the cost inflation we are seeing here in the second half 2018 is continuing into next year. Of course, I'm adjusting our current fourth quarter 2018 unit cost trends for higher fourth quarter capacity growth as well as fourth quarter's 2017's tax reform, employee bonus and charitable contribution, which was about 3 points to fourth quarter of 2017. So our current growth rate continues into next year, and we will shift our #1 focus to control cost in 2019 to arrest that trend. In closing, we had an excellent third quarter, and we were able to expand our net margin and deliver record third quarter earnings per share. These are notable achievements in the industry, and I'd like to thank our more than 58,000 employees for their outstanding efforts. I am very pleased with our rebound in revenue trends in third quarter and our continuing momentum thus far in fourth quarter. Our fuel hedging gains have offset a significant portion of higher market jet fuel prices so far this year, and will continue to provide protection, especially if prices continue to rise. While we face some unit cost inflation next year, I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us to more efficiently scale our growth and drive further productivity and efficiencies, and this will be a primary focus for us next year. We strive to continue delivering very healthy margins as we continue to invest in our future. We continue to deliver higher returns on invested capital, and that will remain a top priority. With that, Abbey, we are ready to take questions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

That \\nyear, the report warned that a “lethal flu, its spread \\nfacilitated by global travel patterns and uncontained \\nby insufficient warning mechanisms, would present \\nan acute threat.” Impacts would include “severe \\nimpairment of travel, tourism and other service \\nindustries, as well as manufacturing and retail supply \\nchains” while “global trade, investor risk appetites \\nand consumption demand” could see longer-term \\nharms. A year later, the report presented a pandemic \\nscenario that illustrated, among other effects, the \\namplifying role of “infodemics” in exacerbating \\nthe core risk. Subsequent editions have stressed \\nthe need for global collaboration in the face of \\nantimicrobial resistance (8th edition, 2013), the Ebola \\ncrisis (11th edition, 2016), biological threats (14th \\nedition, 2019), and overstretched health systems (15th \\nedition, 2020), among other topics.\\n\\nIn 2020, the risk of a global pandemic became reality. \\nAs governments, businesses and societies survey \\nthe damage inflicted over the last year, strengthening \\nstrategic foresight is now more important than \\never. With the world more attuned to risk, there is \\nan opportunity to leverage attention and find more \\neffective ways to identify and communicate risk to \\ndecision-makers.\\n\\nIt is in this context that we publish the 16th edition of \\nthe World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report. \\nOur analysis centres on the risks and consequences \\nof widening inequalities and societal fragmentation. In \\nsome cases, disparities in health outcomes, technology, \\nor workforce opportunities are the direct result of the \\ndynamics the pandemic created. In others, already-\\npresent societal divisions have widened, straining weak \\n\\nsafety nets and economic structures beyond capacity. \\nWhether the gaps can be narrowed will depend on the \\nactions taken in the wake of COVID-19 to rebuild with a \\nview towards an inclusive and accessible future. Inaction \\non economic inequalities and societal divisiveness may \\nfurther stall action on climate change—still an existential \\nthreat to humanity.\\n\\nGrowing societal fragmentation—manifested \\nthrough persistent and emerging risks to human \\nhealth, rising unemployment, widening digital \\ndivides, and youth disillusionment—can have severe \\nconsequences in an era of compounded economic, \\nenvironmental, geopolitical and technological risks. \\nThe gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” \\nwill widen further if technology access and ability \\nremain disparate. The world’s youth have faced \\nexceptional pressures in the past decade and are \\nparticularly vulnerable to missing out altogether on \\nthe opportunities of the next.\\n\\nFor business, the economic, technological and \\nreputational pressures of the present moment risk \\na disorderly shakeout, threatening to create a large \\ncohort of workers and companies that are left behind \\nin the markets of the future. Governments, too, \\nmust balance between managing the pandemic and \\neconomic contraction, while at the same time creating \\nnew opportunities that are fundamental to social \\ncohesion and the viability of their populations. Most \\ncritically, if environmental considerations—the top \\nlong-term risks once again—are not confronted in the \\nshort term, environmental degradation will intersect \\nwith societal fragmentation to bring about dramatic \\nconsequences. If managed poorly, these disruptions \\nwill hamper the ability of policy-makers and other \\nleaders to act on different areas of risk.\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe Global Risks Report 2021\\x0cComplementing the Global Risks Practice, the World \\nEconomic Forum hosts major platforms dedicated \\nto action on building a new economy and society, \\nmobilizing for the climate, managing and disseminating \\nFourth Industrial Revolution technologies, shaping \\nindustry transformations, and enhancing global \\nand regional cooperation. These platforms, and the \\nleaders, networks and organizations they host, apply \\nthe findings of this report in their efforts to tackle the \\nworld’s greatest challenges—managing risks, building \\nresilience and leveraging new opportunities. Such an \\nintegrated approach has never been more critical than \\nat present, as the world moves beyond managing the \\npandemic to resetting our current systems and building \\nback better economies and societies with people and \\nthe planet at the centre of our efforts.\\n\\nThe foundation of the report continues to be our \\nannual Global Risks Perception Survey, completed by \\nover 650 members of the World Economic Forum’s \\ndiverse leadership communities. In addition, the long-\\nstanding and deeply committed Global Risks Advisory \\nBoard shapes the direction of this report from its \\nearliest stages, and provides insight throughout the \\nwriting process. Over the last year, we have also \\nexpanded our efforts around risk and resilience \\nfor decision-makers and for the broader global \\ncommunity. A new Global Future Council on Frontier \\nRisks capitalizes on its diverse and forward-looking \\nmembership to inject fresh thinking into efforts to \\nunderstand and mitigate future risks and to amplify \\nweak signals of coming disruptions in the decades \\nahead. Their ideas are featured in the postscript on \\nFrontier Risks. A new Chief Risk Officers community \\nbrings together leaders in this role in the private sector \\nand major institutions to share methods and views to \\ncollectively enhance capability. \\n\\nWe are ever grateful to our long-standing partners in \\nthe report’s development, Marsh McLennan and Zurich \\nInsurance Group. We welcomed a new partner this \\nyear, SK Group, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude \\nfor the valuable inputs provided. We are also grateful \\nto our academic partners: the National University of \\nSingapore, the Oxford Martin School at the University \\nof Oxford, and the Wharton Risk Management and \\nDecision Processes Center at the University of \\nPennsylvania. Insights from a wide set of experts from \\nthe public and private sectors can also be found in \\nthese pages.\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe Global Risks Report 2021\\x0cExecutive Summary\\n\\nThe immediate human and economic cost of COVID-19 \\nis severe. It threatens to scale back years of progress \\non reducing poverty and inequality and to further \\nweaken social cohesion and global cooperation. Job \\nlosses, a widening digital divide, disrupted social \\ninteractions, and abrupt shifts in markets could lead \\nto dire consequences and lost opportunities for large \\nparts of the global population. The ramifications—in \\nthe form of social unrest, political fragmentation and \\ngeopolitical tensions—will shape the effectiveness of our \\nresponses to the other key threats of the next decade: \\ncyberattacks, weapons of mass destruction and, most \\nnotably, climate change.\\n\\nIn the Global Risks Report 2021, we share the results \\nof the latest Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS), \\nfollowed by analysis of growing social, economic and \\nindustrial divisions, thei'"

Markets are increasingly volatile but resilient, taking hits \\nbut mostly bouncing back. What’s wrong with this picture? \\n\\nNothing … yet. Geopolitical cycles are slow-moving. It takes a long time to build a geopolitical or-\\nder; governments change course through the workings of complex institutions, coalition politics, \\nelection cycles, and checks and balances. Multilateral institutions take decades to build, and they \\ngain momentum slowly. Norms and values need to develop, to become accepted, and to shape \\ninstitutions and societies over time. Once in place, they’re sticky. And so, barring bad luck (read: \\na sudden unforeseen crisis), it takes years, even decades to knock down a geopolitical order. That \\nprocess of erosion is underway around the world today.\\n\\nSure, 2019 could turn out to be the year the world falls apart. Tail risks created by bad actors \\ninflicting damage that then create an escalatory cycle are higher than they’ve been at any point \\nsince we launched Eurasia Group in 1998. A Russian cyberattack gets out of control. Iran and \\nSaudi Arabia (or Israel) trigger a Middle East war. The Chinese and Americans get into a trade war \\nthat causes a deep recession, they blame one another, and retaliation spills into the kinetic space. \\nThere are other risks of similar scale. But for now, all of these remain low-likelihood events. \\n\\nMore likely, and despite increasingly worrisome headlines, 2019 is poised to be a reasonably good \\nyear. Even, dare we say it, not a particularly politically risky year. But we’re setting ourselves up \\nfor trouble down the road. Big trouble. And that’s our top risk. \\n\\nTop Risks 2019\\n\\neurasia group | 2 \\n\\n\\x0cBad seeds\\n\\nThe geopolitical dangers taking shape around the world will bear fruit \\nin the years to come. This is the greatest impact of the G-Zero: The \\nworld’s decision-makers are so consumed with addressing (or failing \\nto address) the daily crises that arise from a world without leadership \\nthat they’re allowing a broad array of future risks to germinate, with \\nserious consequences for our collective midterm future.   \\n\\nThe overwhelming majority of geopolitical dynamics that \\nmatter are now headed in the wrong direction\\n\\nConsider the trajectories of all the current geopolitical dynamics that matter. Start \\nwith the big ones. The strength of political institutions in the US and other ad-\\nvanced industrial economies. The transatlantic relationship. US-China. The state of \\nthe EU. NATO. The G20. The G7. The WTO. Russia and the Kremlin. Russia and its \\nneighbors. Regional power politics in the Middle East. Or in Asia, for that matter. \\n\\nEvery single one of these is trending negatively. Every single one. And most in a way \\nthat hasn’t been in evidence since World War II. Indeed, the overwhelming majority \\nof geopolitical developments that matter, the wide array of issues that we follow at \\nEurasia Group—more than 90% of them—are now headed in the wrong direction. \\n\\nTop Risks 2019\\n\\neurasia group | 3 \\n\\n\\x0cThese relationships and institutions won’t collapse \\ntomorrow, but the risks plaguing them are landmines. \\nThat’s especially important because they’re all piec-\\nes of the international architecture, some of them \\nfoundational. Eventually, people are going to get hurt. \\nThink climate change, but in the geopolitical sphere. \\n\\nLet’s take a closer look at several of these bad seeds.\\n\\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans don’t trust \\nCongress. The political parties have grown further \\napart, and the political center has disappeared—near-\\nly half of all Democrats and Republicans now report \\nthey “hate” the other side. Social media has further \\nundermined people’s trust in what’s true, and there’s \\nno clear message from government on how large in-\\nformation technology companies should be regulated. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Trump has weaponized the divisions \\nbetween his supporters and those who oppose him, \\ntransforming governing institutions into political \\nbattlegrounds, weakening the long-term functionality \\nof a representative democracy, and persuading a larg-\\ner percentage of citizens that the system is “rigged” \\nagainst them. If Trump is defeated in 2020, the trend \\nwill slow. But American liberal democracy and accom-\\npanying values aren’t what they were. No one can put \\nhumpty dumpty back together again. \\n\\na – US political institutions \\n\\nIt’s not urgent. President Donald Trump has been \\nnotably constrained by US institutions—the judiciary \\nslapping limits on his immigration policies, bureau-\\ncrats slow-rolling regulatory changes, and Congress \\nfocused on incremental approaches to change rather \\nthan passing legislation that generates sudden, dra-\\nmatic upheaval. Not to mention preventing Trump \\nfrom taking any measures to impede special counsel \\nRobert Mueller’s investigation. Indeed, after two years \\nof the Trump administration, the most important do-\\nmestic takeaways are how resilient US political institu-\\ntions have proven and how effectively they’ve limited \\nTrump’s intended actions.\\n\\nBut damage is being done to the legitimacy of demo-\\ncratic institutions in the world’s largest economy. The \\nlist of examples is long. Trump publicly contradicts \\nhigh-confidence estimates of US intelligence agencies. \\nHe claims choices made by lead actors at the Justice \\nDepartment and the FBI are politically motivated. He \\ninsists the judiciary is biased against him and that \\njournalists are enemies of the people. \\n\\nb – Europe \\n\\nIt’s not urgent. The ongoing Brexit debacle has made \\nclear that nobody benefits from an exit. That, in turn, \\nhas forced euroskeptic parties like the National Rally \\n(France’s rebranded National Front) and the League \\n(Italy’s former Northern League; why do these far-right \\nparties keep changing their names?) to shift gears. \\n\\nBut nearly every current trend in Europe weakens the \\nbroader European convergence project. Obviously, \\nwithout the Brits, Europe isn’t what it was. With Chan-\\ncellor Angela Merkel in succession mode, neither is \\nGermany. With President Emmanuel Macron at 23% \\n\\nTop Risks 2019\\n\\neurasia group | 4 \\n\\n\\x0capproval, facing a state of national emergency and \\nhis domestic and European-integrationist reforms \\na dead letter, there’s a limit to what can be expected \\nfrom France. Now consider the governments—in Italy \\nand much of eastern Europe—controlled by those who \\nwant to assert more national sovereignty to claw back \\npower from Brussels. Add a more divided European \\nparliament after May elections (please see Top Risk \\n#4), and Europe is headed toward (at best) a more \\nfragmented future or (at worst) a long, slow unwind.\\n\\nPresuming no immediate unforeseen emergencies, \\nEuropean governments can handle shocks more easily \\nwhen there’s decent economic growth and money to \\nspend. But when belts must be tightened, fights be-\\ncome crises. The reason many in the UK voted to leave \\nthe EU is that they recognized it wasn’t fit for purpose \\nover the long term. On that count, they look to be right.\\n\\nability to pursue its interests. That means alliances \\nare eroding and will continue to do so. Transatlantic \\nrelations are in the roughest shape given challenges \\non both sides of the Atlantic; in particular, US-Ger-\\nman and US-French relations are deteriorating. That \\nundercuts NATO and the broader international order. \\nTrump’s skeptical view of alliances could well spread \\nnext to bases and activity in the Middle East.\\n\\nAsia is least affected. Both Trump and the political es-\\ntablishment remain committed to the region, in large \\npart because of China’s rise. The US-Japan alliance \\nremains strong. But even here, watch South Korea, \\nwhere Trump would prefer to reduce the US military \\npresence, while continuing to create uncertainty on \\ntrade. Trump’s doubts about alliances create opportu-\\nnities for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President \\nVladimir Putin, populists in Europe, and others happy \\nto exploit frustration with Washington. This trend will \\nslow if Trump fails to win a second term as president, \\nbut the move toward a more modest conception of \\nAmerican power and a weaker set of alliances began \\nwell before Trump arrived. \\n\\nc – The system of global alliances\\n\\nIt’s not urgent. The US remains a critical ally for most \\nof the world’s developed nations. And it isn’t going \\nhome this year. \\n\\nBut US alliances everywhere are weakening. Trump \\nhas said it’s not America’s job to police the world and \\nother nations must pay for their own security. Trump’s \\nviews on trade are decidedly unilateral. And the US \\nhas stepped well back from promoting common val-\\nues; indeed, it’s hard for the US to agree what Ameri-\\ncan values are. On all three fronts, the Trump admin-\\nistration sees alliances as corsets that restrict the US’s \\n\\nd – Populism/nationalism\\n\\nIt’s not urgent. Aggrieved and disenfranchised popula-\\ntions remain minorities in most developed countries, \\nwith less ability to force change than the elites in \\npower. The political “swamp” resists being drained, \\nand most governments continue to allocate resources \\nmuch as they have over the past several decades.\\n\\nTop Risks 2019\\n\\neurasia group | 5 \\n\\n\\x0cBut these trends are becoming more toxic, especially \\ngiven the growing disintermediation of labor from \\ncapital. The “fourth industrial revolution” is appropri-\\nately named for its beneficiaries—it promises more \\ngrowth and more efficiency. But for those whose jobs \\nare lost to automation and don’t have the education \\nand training to find new employment that demands \\nnew skill sets, it’s a post-industrial revolution. They’ll \\nend up part of an expanding group who believe their \\npolitical systems'"
